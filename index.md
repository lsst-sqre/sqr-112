# Docverse documentation hosting platform design

```{abstract}
For a decade, Rubin Observatory has hosted its documentation sites with its LSST the Docs service. That service provided excellent capabilities and performance, but its implementation is now out of step with our current application design practices and some long-standing bugs and features have been difficult to retrofit. Docverse is the next iteration of LSST the Docs that retains the qualities of hosting versioned, static web documentation, but resolves the feature gaps, performance issues, and bugs we experienced with LSST the Docs.
